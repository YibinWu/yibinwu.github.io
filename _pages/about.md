I am a research associate in the Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation at Bonn University, Bonn, Germany. I obtained my Master degree in Navigation, Guidance, and Control in [i2Nav Lab](http://i2nav.cn/) at Wuhan University in 2020. It was enjoyable and rewarding to be supervised by Prof. [Xiaoji Niu](https://dblp.org/pid/94/652.html) and study within his group. I obtained my Bachelor degree in Navigation Engineering at the same institute in 2017.

[Wheel-INS2: Multiple MEMS IMU-based Dead Reckoning System with Different Configurations for Wheeled Robots](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10593.pdf)
  
**Yibin Wu**, Jian Kuang, Xiaoji Niu, accepted to **IEEE Transations on Intelligent Transportation Systems**, 2022

- A localization system for wheeled robots using multiple low-cost IMUs with comparison on different configurations, e.g., one body-mounted IMU (Body-IMU) plus one wheel-mounted IMU (Wheel-IMU), dual Wheel-IMUs, and dual Wheel-IMUs plus one Body-IMU.
