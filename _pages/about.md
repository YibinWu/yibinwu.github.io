<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD candidate at the [Center for Robotics](https://robotik.uni-bonn.de/Home.html) and [Institute of Geodesy and Geoinformation](https://www.igg.uni-bonn.de/en?set_language=en) in the University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany. My research interest focuses on sensor fusion-based robot perception and navigation. 

<!--I obtained my Master's degree in Navigation, Guidance, and Control in [i2Nav Lab](http://i2nav.cn/) at Wuhan University, Wuhan, China in 2020. It was enjoyable and rewarding to be supervised by Prof. [Xiaoji Niu](https://dblp.org/pid/94/652.html) and study within his group. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Navigation Engineering at the same institute in 2017.-->

I am looking for self-motivated Master students (online/offline) to work on topics about SLAM, multisensor fusion, etc. Please drop me an email.<!--<a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MKOtRJwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>.

**Wheel-GINS: A GNSS/INS Integrated Navigation System with a Wheel-mounted IMU** [[PDF]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.03079) [[Code]](https://github.com/i2Nav-WHU/Wheel-GINS)[ ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/i2Nav-WHU/Wheel-GINS?style=social)](https://github.com/i2Nav-WHU/Wheel-GINS)
  
**Yibin Wu**, Jian Kuang, Xiaoji Niu, Cyrill Stachniss, Lasse Klingbeil, and Heiner Kuhlmann, **IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems**, 2025 

-  Wheel-GINS is an integrated navigation system that combines GNSS data with a wheel-mounted IMU (Wheel-IMU). It performs a similar information fusion process to conventional GNSS/Odometer/IMU integrated systems using only two sensors. Moreover, all Wheel-IMU installation parameters are estimated online in Wheel-GINS, enhancing the system's practicality and adaptability.

**Yibin Wu**, Jian Kuang, Xiaoji Niu, Jens Behley, Lasse Klingbeil, and Heiner Kuhlmann, **IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters**, 2022 

-  A SLAM system using only one low-cost IMU by exploiting the road bank angles (mirrored by the robot roll angles estimated by [Wheel-INS](http://i2nav.cn/ueditor/jsp/upload/file/20210905/1630804325780076093.pdf)) as terrain features to enable the loop closure with a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter. The weights of the particles are updated according to the difference between the currently estimated roll sequence and the terrain map.
